# ðŸ”’ Auth ðŸ”’
Auth System built in [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
Architecture is service oriented that communicate via message queue or direct REST API calls.

How it Works
------------

#### Where does Auth Server stand in service oriented architecture
Auth server is isolated, closely related with nginx api gateway. It can communicate via message queues to other microservices.
You can use [nginx_gateway](https://github.com/vojinpavlovic/nginx_gateway)

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Nginx-->Auth;
    Auth-->Nginx;
    Auth-->Publish-->Queue;
    Nginx-->Resource;
    Resource-->Consume-->Queue;
    Auth-->MySQL;
    Auth-->Redis;
```

#### How does session managment work with microservices
It's behavior is to either send 2xx for success or 4xx for failure as subrequest for nginx and nginx will either proxy pass if 2xx or return 4xx response to customer.

- Case when auth/required returns 2xx status http code
```mermaid
graph TD;
    Customer-->Nginx;
    Nginx-->Auth/Required;
    Auth/Required-->Nginx;
    Nginx-->Protected/Resource;
    Protected/Resource-->Customer
```

- Case when auth/required returns 4xx status http code
```mermaid
graph TD;
    Customer-->Nginx;
    Nginx-->Auth/Required;
    Auth/Required-->Nginx;
    Nginx-->Response/4xx;
    Response/4xx-->Customer;
```

Configuration
-------------
Configuration is one of the project feature. Beside that, it is not clone and run, firstly it needs to be configured to mysql, redis and rabbitmq.
Create .env file and copy everything from [.env.example](https://github.com/vojinpavlovic/auth/blob/main/env.example)

### ENV Configuration

#### Node Enviornment and port
There is three types of ```NODE_ENV```, ```development```, ```test``` and ```production```. If you try to run any other enviornment, application will close.

| Param | Type | Desc | Default |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
| PORT | Int  | Port that server listens to | 3000 |
| NODE_ENV | String  | In which enviornment you want to run node app | development |

#### MySQL database
You probably noticed bold **PROD** in ```DB_PROD_CONN_LIMIT``` below in table. Since there is three enviornments PROD for production, DEV for development and TEST for test.
It is recommended to use three different databases, one for production, one for development and one for test. 

| Param | Type | Desc | Default |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
| DB_**PROD**_CONN_LIMIT | Int  | Maximum connection in MySQL pool | 10 |
| DB_**PROD**_HOST | String  | IP or URL to your database | 127.0.0.1 |
| DB_**PROD**_PORT | Int  | Port that your database listens to | 3306 |
| DB_**PROD**_USER | String  | Your MySQL user | root |
| DB_**PROD**_PASSWORD | String  | Password for your MySQL user | ```empty string``` |
| DB_**PROD**_DATABASE | String  | Your database in MySQL | unnamed_users |

#### Redis Datastore
| Param | Type | Desc | Default |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
| REDIS_**PROD**_URL | String | Url to your Redis host | 127.0.0.1 |
| REDIS_**PROD**_PORT | String | Port to your Redis host | 6379 |
| REDIS_**PROD**_PASS | String | Pass to authenticate to Redis | ```empty string``` |
| REDIS_**PROD**_DB | INT | DB in your Redis (by default there is 15) | ```1``` in PROD, ```2``` in DEV, ```3``` in TEST enviornments |

#### AMQP URL

If you wish to start fast on RabbitMQ, there is cloud hosting, that hosts your RabbitMQ service for free (not production ready) [CloudAMQP](https://www.cloudamqp.com/). Otherwise, instructions how to install RabbitMQ on your machine. [Download and Installing RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)

| Param | Type | Desc | Default |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
| AMQP_URL | String | Url to your AMQP | ```empty``` |

#### Prevent Accidents
By default accident prevention is disabled, but you can enable in .env for key ENABLE_ACCIDENTS_CHECK. By enabling it you need to pass ```1``` otherwise
it will be false.

First, what accidents can we prevent. Let's assume you already established Auth Server and run test, test might in future require to Truncate users table
we don't want that in dev or production, right? But that's okay test will always run in test enviornment, but accidents happens accidently, there is 
possibility to check same database name for both PROD and DEV in TEST variable. This little script will check if database names are same, if so application will not procceed to launch and will exit with error.

| Param | Type | Desc | Default |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
| ENABLE_ACCIDENTS_CHECK | String/Number | Enabling for accident checks | 0 ```false``` |

#### Routes
```
    name_of_endpoint : {
        endpoint: '/some/endpoint',
        method: 'get',
        handler: require('../routes/auth-required')
    },
```
#### Code.js

```
    "type": {
        ttl: 300,
        auth: true,
        codeBytesLengths: 64,
        handler: require('../handlers/some-handler'),
        delAfterHandling: true
    },
```
- ```ttl``` Expiration time for code in Redis Datastore. Code is auto deleted once time has passed. 
- ```auth``` There is situations where you need user to be authenticated to request code, set this to true if the case.
- ```codeBytesLengths``` Length of generated random string.
- ```handler``` When code is validated, handler is called in /verifyCode route if exist in config. Handler must return data with {success: true/false, ...rest of data}. Handler result is returned in response to end user, so be carefull what you put in return.
- ```delAfterHandling``` If handler return { success: true } it will delete code in Redis Datastore
